# PDF Chemical Analysis Extractor (Ollama + LLMs)

A Python tool that extracts chemical-analysis results from PDF reports using a local LLM (Ollama + Mistral/Gemma etc.).  
It processes PDFs in configurable page-chunks, sends each chunk to a local Ollama model, and saves the extracted structured text to an output file.
